# NON-NEGOTIABLE DAILY MERN CHECKLIST

> Goal: Become an employable MERN developer in 6 months  
> Daily time: 1–2 hours  
> Rule: No skipping. No stacking. No excuses.

---

## 🔒 DAILY RULES (READ FIRST)

- ❌ No tutorials longer than 20 minutes
- ❌ No copy-paste without understanding
- ❌ No phone during coding
- ✅ Struggle is expected
- ✅ Confusion means progress
- ✅ Code > videos

---

## 🕒 DAILY STRUCTURE (1–2 HOURS)

### 1️⃣ REVIEW (15 minutes)

- [ ] Re-read yesterday’s notes
- [ ] Re-type yesterday’s code **from memory**
- [ ] Identify 1 thing I still don’t understand

> If I cannot explain it in plain English, I do NOT understand it.

---

### 2️⃣ LEARN ONE CONCEPT ONLY (30–45 minutes)

- [ ] Learn **ONE** new concept (not more)
- [ ] Write:
  - What it is
  - Why it exists
  - Where it is used
- [ ] Write at least **1 example from scratch**

Examples:

- Arrays
- `map()`
- `useState`
- API routes
- MongoDB schema

> If I learn 2 concepts, I actually learned none.

---

### 3️⃣ CODE CHALLENGE (30–45 minutes)

- [ ] Solve **ONE challenge**
- [ ] No tutorials while solving
- [ ] Console.log is allowed
- [ ] Google syntax is allowed
- [ ] Thinking is mandatory

Challenge rules:

- Easy → Medium → Hard
- Hard challenges must reuse old concepts

> If I get stuck for 10 minutes, I break the problem down — I do NOT quit.

---

### 4️⃣ CLEAN CODE PASS (10 minutes)

- [ ] Rename bad variables
- [ ] Remove unnecessary code
- [ ] Reduce lines if possible
- [ ] Ask: “Can a stranger read this?”

Checklist:

- ❌ `x`, `temp`, `data1`
- ✅ `users`, `activeTrucks`, `totalCost`

---

### 5️⃣ AI CODE REVIEW (MANDATORY)

Paste your code and ask:

> “Review my code harshly.  
> Point out:
>
> - bad logic
> - unclear naming
> - unnecessary lines
> - better patterns”

- [ ] Apply at least **ONE correction**

---

## 🧠 DAILY REFLECTION (5 minutes)

Write **short answers**:

- What did I learn today?
- What confused me the most?
- What concept is getting clearer?
- What will I improve tomorrow?

---

## 🚨 FAILURE PROTOCOL (VERY IMPORTANT)

If today was bad:

- [ ] I still open VS Code
- [ ] I still type **something**
- [ ] I do NOT skip the day

> A bad session is better than no session.

---

## 📆 WEEKLY CHECK (END OF WEEK)

- [ ] What concepts can I explain without notes?
- [ ] What concepts feel weak?
- [ ] What challenge was hardest?
- [ ] What did I reuse from past weeks?

---

## 🧱 NON-NEGOTIABLE COMMITMENT

I commit to:

- Showing up daily
- Building real projects
- Choosing long-term skill over short-term comfort
