# 6-Month MERN Stack Roadmap — Mini TMS (LOCKED)

## Goal

Build a **real-world Trucking Management System (TMS)**  
Become **job-ready MERN developer** in 6 months  
Focus: logic, systems thinking, real features

Daily commitment: ~2 hours  
Rule: build > watch > debug > explain

---

## PHASE 1: JavaScript Logic — “The Dispatcher”

**Focus:** Thinking in data, rules, and conditions (NO frameworks)

### Week 1: Core JavaScript Foundations

**Goal:** Absolute control over logic

- Day 1: `let` vs `const`, data types, truthy/falsy
- Day 2: `if / else`, `else if`, strict equality (`===`)
- Day 3: `for`, `while` loops (manual iteration)
- Day 4: Objects & property access
- Day 5: Arrays + manual loops
- Day 6: Functions (parameters, return values)
- Day 7: **Challenge:** Dispatch decision engine

---

### Week 2: Modern JavaScript Data Tools

**Goal:** Replace manual loops with expressive logic

- Day 1: Arrow functions
- Day 2: `.map()` (transform data)
- Day 3: `.filter()` (business rules)
- Day 4: `.reduce()` (totals, reports)
- Day 5: `.find()` & `.some()`
- Day 6: Combining methods
- Day 7: **Challenge:** Revenue & driver performance logic

---

### Week 3: DOM & Events — “The Dashboard”

**Goal:** Make logic visible and interactive

- Day 1: `querySelector`, `getElementById`
- Day 2: Click events (status updates)
- Day 3: Inputs & form values
- Day 4: Creating DOM elements
- Day 5: Removing elements
- Day 6: `localStorage` persistence
- Day 7: **Mini-Project:** Interactive Dispatch Board

---

### Week 4: Async JavaScript

**Goal:** Handle time, delays, and failures

- Day 1: `setTimeout`, event loop concept
- Day 2: Promises
- Day 3: `async / await`
- Day 4: Fetch API (GET)
- Day 5: Error handling (`try/catch`)
- Day 6: Logic drills (async scenarios)
- Day 7: **Challenge:** Simulated load fetcher

---

### Week 5: Git, Tooling & Capstone

**Goal:** Work like a professional

- Day 1: Terminal navigation
- Day 2: Git init, add, commit
- Day 3: GitHub push & repo hygiene
- Day 4: Branching & merging
- Day 5: NPM & `package.json`
- Day 6: Date handling (`date-fns` or native Date)
- Day 7: **Capstone:** Fleet Dashboard (HTML/CSS/JS)

---

## PHASE 2: React — “The UI Layer”

### Week 6: Components & Props

- JSX, components, props, conditional rendering

### Week 7: State & Effects

- `useState`, `useEffect`, forms, arrays in state

### Week 8: Routing

- React Router, dynamic routes, protected layouts

### Week 9: Styling System

- Tailwind CSS, responsive layouts, reusable components

---

## PHASE 3: Backend — “The Engine”

### Week 13: Node & Express

- REST APIs, routes, controllers

### Week 14: MongoDB & Mongoose
