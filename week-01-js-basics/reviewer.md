# Variables (`let`, `const`)

A variable is a labeled box
const = cannot be reassigned <!-- const userName = "JESSIE" -->
let = can be reassigned <!-- let userAge = 22 -->
Use const by default
Variable names are communication

# Data types

String → text for humans <!-- const name = "JESSIE" -->
Number → math and calculations <!--  let age = 22 -->
Boolean → decisions (true / false) <!-- const programmer = true -->
undefined → never assigned <!-- let programmingKnowlege -->
null → intentionally empty <!-- const pet = null -->

Data types exist so JavaScript doesn’t guess.

# Operators

Operators make values do work
Arithmetic = math ( + - \ \* %)
Comparison = truth <> >= =<
Logical = decisions ||, &&
=== tells the truth
Parentheses remove doubt

=== checks value and type
!== checks inequality safely
&& = all conditions must pass <!-- (true && false ) = false -->
|| = any condition can pass <!-- (true || flase) = true -->
